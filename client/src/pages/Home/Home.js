With a full-stack development certificate from the University of Washington, I am well-learned in JavaScript, React.js, mySQL, and MongoDB, among other skills. Holding a bachelor's degree with a leadership focus, I have successfully managed communications for the non-profit Vision Rescue and have had a progressive medical management career with CityMD. 
        <br/><br/>
        At Vision Rescue, I successfully established a new on-field reporting system that helped me create regular newsletters, presentations, and web content for global distribution to current and prospective partners. In my progressive medical management experience at CityMD, I was able to not only facilitate incredible Press Ganey scores at my clinics but cultivate a loyal patient and staff base who were committed through a company transition. My experience has molded me to be inventive, understanding and end-user mindful.
        <br/><br/> 
        Ultimately, I am a contagiously joyful worker, driven by the desire to create meaningful tools and products for clients while cultivating healthy team dynamics.
